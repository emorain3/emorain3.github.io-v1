      <li>How much does it cost to come out?</li>
        <p> - $75.</p>
      <li>How much does it cost for installation?</li>
        <p>- This depends on a lot of factors from the type of system you have to 
          the size of your home. To fully answer this question you'd be better off contacting us</p>
      <li>System not working? </li>
        <p>- A common cause for a failing system is simply insufficient electric supply 
          or a need to reset the main circuitboard. In both of these cases simply 
          shutting off the power to the system and turning it back on will usually get things 
          working again and save from unnecessary headache. Find the main power supply, 
          or the breaker box, and turn off the power often labelled 'Furnace' or 'AC unit'. 
          If this doesn't work or is simply too dificult to find feel free to give us a call.</p>
